<h1 align="left">PANDAS<br><i>Topic: School Performance Analysis</i> </h1> 

<p>This project analyzes a city school district's standardized test results to identify trends in school performance. The data includes math and reading scores for each student along with various information on the schools they attend.

## Features
* District Summary: Provides an overview of key metrics for the entire district, including the total number of unique schools, total students, total budget, average math and reading scores, and the percentage of students passing math, reading, and both subjects.
* School Summary: Offers a detailed summary of each school's key metrics, including school type, total students, total budget, per student budget, average math and reading scores, and the percentage of students passing math, reading, and both subjects.
* Top and Bottom Performing Schools: Lists the top 5 and bottom 5 schools based on the percentage of overall passing students.
* Math and Reading Scores by Grade: Shows the average math and reading scores for students in each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
* Scores by School Spending, Size, and Type: Examines school performance based on average spending per student, school size, and school type.

## Conclusions 
The analysis of the school district's standardized test results revealed the following trends:

* Schools with higher per-student spending did not necessarily have better overall passing rates. In fact, schools with lower spending per student often outperformed those with higher spending.
* Smaller schools (< 2000 students) had higher overall passing rates compared to larger schools (> 2000 students).

## Limitations and Further Development
This analysis is limited by the available data and does not consider other factors that may influence school performance, such as teacher quality, extracurricular activities, or socioeconomic factors.

To gain a deeper understanding of the factors affecting school performance, additional research should be conducted on the relationship between teacher qualifications, class size, and student performance. Moreover, the impact of socioeconomic factors on student achievement should also be investigated to better inform budgeting and policy decisions.
